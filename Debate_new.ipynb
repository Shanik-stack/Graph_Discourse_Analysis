What we perceive (as living organisms) to be moral on a fundamental level arises from our biology. \\r\\nWe\\'ve evolved to consider as \"good\" the things that serve our instincts of survival and reproduction and as \"bad\" things that go against our basic instincts. This means that the basis of morality in humans is natural, and then specificities that come from that basis are mostly social constructs', 'No attempt by philosophers to bridge the is/ought divide has yet succeeded.', 'Normative (moral) properties are quite commonly used in the natural sciences. The study of medicine and biology makes natural use of notions about how organs \"ought\" to function.', 'In medicine, these ought claims are attached to an implied \"in order to be healthy\". Doctors are paid to keep people healthy, and for them to \\r\\nquestion whether, in an objective sense, one \"ought\" to be healthy is counterproductive or irrelevant.', 'It is possible for people to draw differing conclusions from the same facts because they have unique prior experiences and value judgments\\r\\n about the world that they will subconsciously rely on when evaluating the same evidence.', \"The principle of Occam's razor states that, all things being equal, the simplest explanation is the best.\", 'The Open Question Argument argues that if moral properties were natural properties, then \"yes\" would logically follow from \"is [eg. pleasure] goodness?\" just like \"yes\" follows from \"is H20 water?\". However, intuitively the former question requires a much more open answer to the latter. This indicates that moral properties are not self-evidently natural.', 'There\\'s no natural property or set of natural properties which are synonymous with \"good\" or \"bad\" - good and bad are judgments we make of natural properties and so can\\'t be identical to these natural properties. Saying pleasure is good is not the same as saying \"pleasure is pleasure\" and so can\\'t be identical.', 'H2O is water by definition (as otherwise, some substance not made of H2O but with indistinguishable macroscopic properties to H2O could be accurately classified as \"water\"). The same would apply to questions like \"Is X goodness?\", the only difference being that X is more difficult to fully define in terms of natural properties.', 'Moral properties are capable of explaining human intuitions in relation to moral dilemmas.', 'There are no truly objective morals. The example of \"murder\" is a semantic deception where intentional death is labeled after the fact to show condemnation, rather than being an intrinsic quality clearly different than \"defense\", \"accident\", \"euthanasia\", \"sacrifice\" or \"execution\".
